                        focus on preventing dental diseases. We believe that
                        prevention is just as
                        important as the treatment we can provide. <br /><b>What to expect at your dental check up?</b>
                        <br />
                        At Evergreen Dental Care your preventative dental check-up will include: <br />
                        1. A comprehensive examination of all your teeth to assess for dental decay, fractures,
                        excessive tooth wear, and
                        assessment of your existing fillings/crowns etc.<br />
                        2. A thorough assessment of the gums to check for gum disease.<br />
                        3. An oral cancer screening including a thorough assessment of the soft tissue in the
                        mouth.<br />
                        4. A screening of the head, neck and face for abnormalities, swelling or tenderness.<br />
                        5. A thorough assessment of the jaw joint and facial muscles.<br />
                        6. We will give you advice and guidance on your oral hygiene and home dental care.<br />
                        7. You will have the opportunity to ask questions about our services and to bring up any

                        measures, many people at some stage of life will require a
                        dental filling because of
                        tooth decay, wear or an accident leading to a damaged tooth.<br />
                        When decay forms it is necessary to receive a filling to stop the spread and to regain the
                        strength of your original
                        tooth. If left, decay can continue to spread in the tooth, and to surrounding teeth. When decay
                        spreads, it causes
                        structural damage to the tooth and can start affecting the nerve leading to pain and the need
                        for more complex and
                        costly treatment.<br />
                        At Evergreen Dental Care we have several filling material options to restore your teeth and can
                        discuss the best choice
                        depending on the site, size, and function of the tooth to be restored.<br />
                        In most cases the shape, appearance and function of the tooth is restored using a tooth coloured
                        composite resin
                        filling. Composite resin fillings are colour matched to the shade of your teeth, providing an
                        aesthetically pleasing
                        restoration that can be moulded to an exact fit. Our skilled dentists use the latest bonding
                        techniques to achieve
                        strong, durable, and natural looking fillings.<br />
                        If you have a cavity, a broken tooth or would like to replace any of your old defective
                        fillings, contact Evergreen
                        Dental Care to make an appointment.</p>

                        part of your regular dental check-ups, and generally

                <div class="panel">
                    <p style="color: lightslategray; padding-bottom: 10px;">The aim of root canal treatment is to a save
                        a tooth when its nerve has become inflamed or
                        infected. It involves the
                        removal of the inflamed/infected nerve tissue from a tooth’s root. <br />
                        Infection/inflammation of the nerve can be caused by several things including: breakdown of a
                        filling or crown, a deep
                        cavity, trauma, gum disease, cracks or chips, severe wear or extensive dental work on a
                        tooth.<br />
                        When the nerve becomes inflamed the tooth can become very painful with symptoms such as hot/cold
                        sensitivity, pain on
                        biting, swelling and disturbed sleep.<br />
                        Root canal treatment often gets a bad reputation being associated with a lot of pain. This is
                        because when patients need
                        root canal treatment they usually are already experiencing a lot of pain from an
                        infected/inflamed nerve. The root canal
                        treatment is what actually gets the patient OUT of pain.</p>
